```{r}
##1. Use rnorm() to create 2 random variables with 20 observations each 
x<-rnorm(20)
y<-rnorm(20)
##Calculate the correlation between the two variables 
cor(x,y)
#Repeat process many times 
set.seed(123)
correlations<-replicate(1000,{
  x<-rnorm(20)
  y<-rnorm(20)
  cor(x,y)})

#Plot distribution of correlation coefficients and report standard deviation
hist(correlations, main="Distribution of Correlation Coefficients, n=20", 
     xlab="Correlation")
sd(correlations)

#What do we expect the correlation between the two variables to be? 
#We would expect the correlation between these two random variables,
#on average, to be 0. 
#They are independent of each other and have no causal relationship and 
#so as one increases or 
#decreases we would not expect this to impact the other variable. 

#What does this distribution tell us about sample 
#estimates of population parameters? This distribution tells us that 
#sample estimates of the population vary. 
#The distribution shows, when pulled from n=20, that there are observations of 
#correlation coefficients between
#-.6 and .6 depending on the iteration. A single sample estimate is, therefore, 
#insufficient for accurately capturing the 
#population parameter especially when the sample is small. 


#2 Repeat the previous step with n=1000
x<-rnorm(1000)
y<-rnorm(1000)
##Calculate the correlation between the two variables 
cor(x,y)
#Repeat process many times 
set.seed(123)
correlations<-replicate(1000,{
  x<-rnorm(1000)
  y_<-rnorm(1000)
  cor(x,y)})
#plot distribution
hist(correlations, main="Distribution of Correlation Coefficients(n=1000)", 
     xlab="Correlation")
#Substantive interpretation of how results differ? 
#The distribution for the larger sample (n=1000) is more evenly 
#distributed than the smaller sample (n=20) which displays more variance. 
#The distribution of the smaller sample size of n=20 shows the data as having 
#a larger standard deviation than that of the n=1000 sample. This demonstrates 
#that smaller samples sizes will have more variance because they are not as 
#representative of the true population. 
#Each observation in the smaller sample is a greater average 
#distance from the mean than the observations in a larger sample size, 
##which are a smaller average distance from the mean. 

#3 create 3 random variables, z causes x and y
z<-rnorm(1000)
x<-.3*z+rnorm(1000)
y<-2*z+rnorm(1000)

###Plot x and y on a scatter plot 
plot (x,y, main="Scatter Plot of X and Y", xlab="x values", ylab="y values" )
#Report correlation
cor(x,y)
#What does this tell us about reporting correlation? 
#This demonstrates that unrelated variables can still be shown as 
#having a correlation. Therefore, we should be careful about associating a 
#correlation with a causal relationship as both x and y in this case are not 
#causally related, and yet, they have a positive correlation. We should also 
#consider possible variables that may confound results. In this case, where z 
#has a causal relationship with both x and y but x and y have no causal 
#relationship, a non-zero positive correlation coefficient exists 
#between x and y. Overall, we should not equate correlation as causation and 
#we should consider confounding variables as factors in 
#interpretations of correlations.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
